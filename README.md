KayakApp -- Trabajo Fin de Grado -- USAL -- Pablo Rubio


This project aims to develop an application that helps the paddlers with an Android device monitor their training sessions, taking advantage of the different sensors and equivalents that mobile phones have (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.). The physical data retrieved can be used to study and have control over training, in order to make decisions aimed at improving athletes' sports performance.
